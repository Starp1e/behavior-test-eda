# behavior-test-eda
Hi! This is an EDA w/ some classification algorythms that I created for my course paper on behavioral biases and consumer trends in food retail. Please enjoy!

This repo contains only html version of my Jupyter Notebook. If you want to play with code yourself - feel free to DM me in Telegram (@FlamingNerd)

You can look up the questionnaire used here via link (Ukrainian language only) -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aV0QoeG_Q8x69bO3VQlz1OgBJ-Kwp7mB/view?usp=sharing
